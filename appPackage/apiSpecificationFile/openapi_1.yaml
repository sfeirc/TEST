      summary: Generate a full PowerPoint-style slide plan from business context.
      description: |
        Given a customer context, value proposition, and constraints (timeline, SLA, penalties),
        return a slide-by-slide narrative that can be turned into a commercial / executive deck.
        The style must follow Infotel's branding tone: business-focused, concise, no marketing fluff,
        and clear bullets ready to paste in PowerPoint.
